strongs-xmltodokuwiki
==========

Converts Strongs XML files to DokuWiki formatted files which are named after
their Strongs number.

The Hebrew Strongs conversion script requires HebrewStrong.xml from
https://github.com/openscriptures/HebrewLexicon.  By default, it assumes that
this repo is one level up, it loads "../HebrewLexicon/HebrewStrong.xml".
